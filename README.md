# IoT-Gauges
This repository provides the code to read data from a measuring gauge which already has the hardware to provide digital data output and report it wirelessly on internal (Raspberry Pi) server. This is a simple use case, actual code is more complex and includes some proprietary code & hardware thus omitted. I have covered here most of the part that can be shared in my power. Feel free to contact me :)

*Disclaimer:*
The actual project is based on ESP32 coupled with ATmega2560 mounted on custom designed PCB for optimized and enhanced operation. The above code with slight modifications can be used as it is with ESP8266(ESP - 01) and ATmega328P (Uno/Nano). I won't include long licence agreements, as this is my tiny bit of help to the community so try not to get me in trouble! ;)
